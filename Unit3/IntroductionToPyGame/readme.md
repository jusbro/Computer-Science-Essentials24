# Introduction to Pygame

Welcome to Introduction to Pygame! In this repository, you will find four fun projects to help you get started with game development using Pygame. These projects are designed to introduce you to Pygame's basics, including creating game objects, handling user input, collision detection, and more.

## Files

To get started, you'll need to access the following four files:

1. **Begone Block!**
2. **Floppy Burd**
3. **Pong AI**
4. **Imperial Invaders From not This Planet**

## Instructions

Follow these steps to get the most out of this repository:

1. **Copy the Projects**: Copy all four projects into your VS Code environment.
   
2. **Play the Games**: Run each game and play it to get a feel for how it works. Experiment with different inputs and observe how the game responds.

3. **Read and Understand the Code**: Take some time to read through the code for each game. Try to understand how different parts of the code contribute to the game's behavior.

4. **Add Comments**: Add a minimum of ten comments to each file. Comments should explain key concepts, functions, classes, or any other important parts of the code. Use comments to document your understanding and ask questions if something is unclear.

5. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask questions if you're confused about any part of the code or how the game works. Learning from others and seeking clarification is an important part of the learning process.
